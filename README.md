# nodeJS
Node.js is an open source, cross-platform runtime environment for developing server-side and networking applications.
Node.js applications are written in JavaScript.

All APIs of Node.js library are asynchronous, that is, non-blocking. It essentially means a Node.js based server never waits for an API to return data. 

Node.js uses a single threaded model with event looping. Event mechanism helps the server to respond in a non-blocking way and makes the server highly scalable as opposed to traditional servers which create limited threads to handle requests.
